##### Define bot

This bot uses [puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) to scrape definitions from dictionry.com.

The bot itself was created as a personal programming exercise to play with the API. To use the bot you need to sign up to Discord and [create your own bot](https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/how-to-make-a-discord-bot/), then add the bot to your server and use the code found in define-bot.js.

To define a word use '!define' followed by the word you want to define.
